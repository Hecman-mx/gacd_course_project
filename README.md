Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Making Modifications to This Script
This script was created and configured to run automatically, it will download and install the libraries needed, the proccess will ask you to restart the R after install the fisrt and second libraries, be sure to select no to continue the flow of the script.
The script will create a folder named "gacd_course_project", the tidy data set will be created in this folder, another subfolder named "data" will be created and it will store the data source directly from the url given.


### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
